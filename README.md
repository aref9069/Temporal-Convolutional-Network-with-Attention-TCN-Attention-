# Temporal-Convolutional-Network-with-Attention-TCN-Attention-
This repository provides a full pipeline for Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction using the NASA C-MAPSS dataset. It includes structured preprocessing, advanced feature engineering, a Temporal Convolutional Network with Attention (TCN-Attention) model, and robust evaluation and visualization tools.


📦 Features

✅ Clean ingestion of raw C-MAPSS files

✅ Normalization based on grouped operating conditions

✅ Piecewise linear RUL labeling 

✅ Sliding window sequence generation for deep models

✅ Training, evaluation, and logging of TCN-Attention model

✅ Model evaluation using RMSE, MAE, R², and NASA score

✅ Automatic visualizations and CSV result export


⚙️ Requirements

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow matplotlib
